#Short Description of Myself with a little surprise.
Hey wanderer!

Sanket here! I like programming in various different programming languages including Java, Python, C and almost all it's subordinate versions, Javascript, Web-application languages and the list continues... I am a knowledge seeker and I breathe video games. On top of that I am also a tech enthusiast. Pretty boring, I know...But that's what i like. 
Outdoor activities are my cup of tea anyday everyday. Oh yea, I also love food and with that I also like to cook. 

Nice to meet you wanderer. 

And here is the surprise (Two short limericks):
  
  Python
Python was a language for you and for me
It was simple and clean, but slow we agree.
But that was ok,
We loved it anyway.
Until it went from version 2 to version 3.

  JavaScript
JavaScript was made for the masses,
It lacked types, and modules, and classes.
But it became quite the giant,
Because it ran on server and client,
Until it crashed both, despite 100 test passes.
